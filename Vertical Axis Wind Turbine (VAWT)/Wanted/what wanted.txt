Yes. All good. I look forward to hearing from you.

So, they are looking for the project items above and all that you can do
as with the aerodynamics. Simulative Computational Dynamics. Structural 
and Explicit dynamics. Rigid and Static dynamics. Finite element analytics
. Fluid dynamics. Heat transfer. Plot, graph or contour, as with Pressure,
 Velocity, Temperature.

Have a good night and see you soon. Bye bye of now. 
Best regards, 
Conrad

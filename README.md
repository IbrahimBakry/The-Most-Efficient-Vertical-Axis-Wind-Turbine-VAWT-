# The-Most-Efficient-Vertical-Axis-Wind-Turbine-VAWT-
The project aimed to design the most efficient Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) by optimizing blade design, directors (wind guides), and base configuration to maximize rotational speed and torque. Extensive CFD simulations were conducted using ANSYS to evaluate different configurations, with some simulations taking up to 2-3 days to complete.
